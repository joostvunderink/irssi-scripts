irssi-scripts
=============

These are the scripts for the IRC clients irssi that I have written.

Dejunk
------

The script dejunk.pl hides some junk from you. This is mainly useful
if you are in a channel with a lot of people. Dejunk will hide all
joins, parts, quits and nickchanges in large channels for all clients
that have not been active recently.

So you only see joins, parts, quits and nickchanges that are relevant.
